## **git commit**

---

The `git commit` command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project. Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.

Prior to the execution of `git commit`, The [git add][1.4.1] command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit. **<ins>These two commands `git commit` and `git add` are two of the most frequently used.<ins>**

Command usage:

```bash =
git commit -m "commit message"
```
This is the usual way to commit. shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message. By default, git commit will open up the locally configured text editor, and prompt for a commit message to be entered. Passing the -m option will forgo the text editor prompt in-favor of an inline message.
