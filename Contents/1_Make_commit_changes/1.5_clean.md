## **git clean**

---

Git clean is to some extent an 'undo' command. The `git clean` command operates on untracked files. Untracked files are files that have been created within your repo's working directory but have not yet been added to the repository's tracking index using the [`git add`][1.5.1] command.

Command usage:

```bash =
git clean
```
