## **git add**

---

The command

```bash =
git add [file]
```

adds the specified file present in the working directory to the staging area.

To add all files to the staging area (except for the ignored ones listed in .gitignore), issue the command: 

```bash =
git add .
```

`git add` tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way â€” changes are not actually recorded until you run [`git commit`][1.3.1].<br>
In conjunction with these commands, you'll also need [`git status`][1.3.2] to view the state of the working directory and the staging area.

[1.3.1]: ./1.5_commit.md
[1.3.2]: ./1.4_status.md
