## **git checkout**

---

The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by [`git branch`][2.2.1]. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch. Think of it as a way to select which line of development you’re working on.

Once created a new branch, you can then use `git checkout new_branch` to switch to that branch. Additionally, The git checkout command accepts a -b argument that acts as a convenience method which will create the new branch and immediately switch to it. You can work on multiple features in a single repository by switching between them with git checkout.

```bash =
git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞
```

The above example simultaneously creates and checks out ＜new-branch＞.
