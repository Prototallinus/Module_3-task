## **git branch**

---

A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.

The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesnâ€™t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the [`git checkout`][2.1.1] and [`git merge`][2.1.2] commands.

The command

```bash =
git branch
```

lists all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with `git branch --list`.
