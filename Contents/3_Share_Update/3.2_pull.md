## **git pull**

---

The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 

As stated in the [`git fetch`][3.2.1] page, `git pull` combines `git fetch` and [`git merge`][3.2.2].

Command:

```bash =
git pull 
```
