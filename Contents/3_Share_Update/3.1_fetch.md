## **git fetch**

---

The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.

When downloading content from a remote repo, [`git pull`][3.1.1] and git fetch commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider git fetch the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download the remote content but not update your local repo's working state, leaving your current work intact. git pull is the more aggressive alternative; it will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute [`git merge`][3.1.2] to create a merge commit for the new remote content.

Command:

```bash =
git fetch 
```
