## **git push**

---

The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to [`git fetch`][3.3.1], but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.

Command:

```bash =
git push
```
